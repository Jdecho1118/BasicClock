**Description:**
This JavaScript code provides functionality to create a simple digital clock display. It updates the current time every second and displays it in hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM format. The clock is displayed in a designated HTML element with the id 'clock'.

**Usage:**
1. Ensure you have an HTML file containing an element with the id 'clock' where you want the clock to be displayed. For example:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Digital Clock</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <div id="clock"></div>
       <script src="clock.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
   Save this file as `index.html`.

2. Copy the provided JavaScript code into a file named `clock.js`.

3. Place the `clock.js` file in the same directory as your `index.html`.

4. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

5. You should see the digital clock displayed in the `clock` div, updating every second.

**Modification:**
- If you want to modify the appearance or behavior of the clock, you can edit the `updateClock()` function in the `clock.js` file. You can customize the format of the time display, adjust the interval of updating the clock, or add additional features as per your requirements.
